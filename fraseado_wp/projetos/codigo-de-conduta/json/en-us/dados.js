It works as a compass, assisting us to navigate between possible choices in each situation so that we are able to make the right decision.</p> <p>However, the Code of Conduct is not intended to provide answers to every possible situation that may arise. Consequently, we all need to ponder whether our own conduct and that of our colleagues is aligned with Promon’s values and ethical behavior. We must be proactive, seeking support through the established channels to clarify doubts, to share concerns and to lodge complaints whenever necessary.</p> <p>Promon is the expression of its professional staff value and, with the help and commitment of everyone, we are confident that our Organization will continue to retain the reputation of which we are proud and that sustains our development.</p> <p>Sincerely,</p> <p>Luiz Ernesto Gemignani / President of the Board of Administration <br> Luiz Fernando T.

						"<p>An organizational culture does not consist of statements, but rather of everyday practices and actions. Accordingly, the words that reflect our Beliefs, Reason for Being and Values must be anchored on the verbs, that is to say, the actions that make us what we are - Promon.</p><h3>Beliefs</h3><ul><li>A company is a living organism, an integral part of a social, economic and natural ecosystem with which the company interacts, of which the company is dependent and for whose preservation the company is co-responsible.</li><li>Knowledge will be the enabling instrument for individual and social fulfilment if consciously used and socially shared.</li></ul><h3>Reason for being</h3><p>Promon is knowledge based professional community identified by its capacity to innovate and its quest for excellence, making its objective to:</p><ul><li>Engage in ventures and provide infrastructure solutions that create value for its clients and other stakeholders;</li><li>Provide the conditions for professional and human fulfillment to its employees;</li><li>Play the role of an active agent in the process of combining social development with environment preservation.</li></ul><p>To belong to a Community means to have things in common, to share understandings that transcend the parts into which the company is divided. To be part of a Community implies the willingness to comply with rules and principles, but also implies voluntary collaboration, much richer and less programmed. Collaboration is not altruism. It is born when people share a cause and feel they are part of a common destiny. A community can be described, can be mapped in formal terms, but it also has an emotional meaning, a sentiment of bonding, of union. Communities have a body, but mainly they have a soul.</p><h3>Values</h3><p>Integrity – Devote yourself entirely. Act in an ethical, consistent and professional way.</p><p>Respect – Try to consider the motivation of others, understand all points-of-view involved. Listen to opinions, build consensus.</p><p>Trust – Believe you are capable, understand your potential and limitations, strive continually to excel. Believe in yourself and in others, contribute to the group.</p><p>Dignity – Preserve and enhance your self-respect and self-esteem. Instill esteem and gain authority as consequence of knowledge and experience.</p> <p>Equity – Perceive yourself as part of the whole, recognize the contribution of each one. Fight against all kinds of discrimination, including those which originate from prejudice against race, creed, gender or sexual preference.</p><p>Justice – Offer everyone what they’re entitled to, understand the impacts of a decision. Position yourself with wisdom, courage and generosity.</p><p>Independence – Use your knowledge to provide the best solution with total independence and impartiality. Be able to decide your own destiny.</p><p>Good humor – Be able to see things in a light, creative way. Find meaning and satisfaction in what you do.</p>"

Think of some situations, such as the following:</p> <ul><li>Can my personal interests interfere with the decisions I need to make on behalf of Promon?</li><li>Am I participating in a selection process involving as a possible supplier a company where a relative holds a relevant position or has over 5% of stock participation?</li><li>Could my personal relationships be affected by my decisions relative to service or product contracts?</li><li>Would I feel comfortable if I had to make public to my colleagues at work, friends or the press my professional actions or decisions with a potential conflict of interest?</li></ul> <h3>What to do</h3> <ul><li>Whenever any form of emotional tie is established with a professional and there is any level of hierarchical subordination or influence over administrative or operational decisions between the two, this relationship must be reported to your manager and to the Human Relations Department.</li><li>You should abstain from making decisions which may be influenced by your personal interests when they conflict with Promon's.</li><li>Inform your manager or the Compliance Department of facts that may be construed as a situation of conflict of interest.</li></ul> <h3>What not to do</h3> <ul><li>Do not make use of your position in the company or of confidential Information to fulfill interests other than Promon's.</li><li>Do not perform parallel activities that conflict directly or indirectly with Promon’s business, interests and activity sectors.</li><li>Do not get involved in hiring, supervising, managing or planning the career of any relative contracted by Promon or by suppliers, partners or clients.</li><li>Do not get involved in managing the relation with a company where a relative of yours has a management position, the power to influence the relationship with Promon or holds over 5% of stock.</li><li>Do not allow your relationship with third parties to influence commercial decisions made on behalf of Promon.</li> <li>Do not hide the existence of an emotional or family relationship with another professional, when there is hierarchical subordination or influence over decisions between the two of you.</li></ul> <h3>Get to know more</h3> <p>In case of any doubts, get in touch with the Compliance Department.</p> <h3>Situations</h3> <p><b>My cousin has a company that supplies materials to a Promon administrative department.

However, you should communicate this fact to the Compliance Department in writing. The Department and your manager will establish the best way to deal with this situation. In this case, you will not take part, either directly or indirectly, in the supplier’s selection process or in handling the contract, approval of purchase orders, payments, addenda and others.</p> <p><b>I am working on a consultancy project for a client. We need to sub-contract an office specialized in urbanism and my sister works for one of the offices which submitted an offer. Is there a conflict of interest?</b> <br> Yes, your personal relationship could be construed as a conflict of interest between those of your sister and those of the client for whom you are working. As a result, you should report to the Compliance Department in writing about your relationship. The Compliance Department and your manager will decide the best way to deal with this situation. In any case, it is not appropriate for you to take part in the decision to select the supplier, and in the event that your sister's company is selected, you cannot participate in handling the contract, approval of purchase orders, payments, addenda and others.</p> <p><b>My area will audit the procedures of my boy/girlfriend’s area.

						"<p>Providing entertainment and hospitality (airline tickets, land transportation, lodging), offering and accepting meals, presents or gifts are common practice in business relations either to improve business relationships or to show courtesy.</p><p>However, in no circumstances may meals, gifts, presents, entertainment or hospitality be offered or accepted in a manner that could compromise or give the impression of influencing your independence of judgement or that of third parties in taking commercial decisions.</p><h3>What you should know or assess</h3><p>Offering and accepting meals, gifts, presents, entertainment or hospitality in a relationship with a public or private agent is regulated in many countries and may be viewed as bribery. It is therefore essential for you to know and comply with the <i>Procedure for Offering and Accepting Meals, Gifts, Presents, Entertainment and Hospitality</i>, the policies and procedures of the third parties to whom the meals, gifts, presents, entertainment or hospitality are being offered, and the legislation in force in the countries with which we have established commercial ties.</p><p>The context and reasons for offering or receiving  meals, gifts, presents, entertainment or hospitality must be analyzed with caution, especially at moments when they may be interpreted as a way to influence third parties or Promon’s employees in decision-making. Critical situations include, among others: proposal presentation to a client or when accepting third parties proposals, at the signing of contracts and addenda with clients, partners or suppliers, at licenses or  concessions authorized by public agencies and others.</p><p>Public agents are subject to specific legislation and dealings with them are a source of special concern to Promon. The term “Public agent”, generally speaking, comprises managers or employees of any organ, agency or legal entity of the state or government at any level, including managers or employees of state companies and national or international public organizations. Likewise, it includes candidates for political office, managers and employees of political parties and also the political parties themselves.</p><p>The definition of public agent is a broad one. Some examples of public agents with whom Promon has or may have dealings are fiscal inspectors, customs officials, employees of state companies, secretaries of government, employees of environmental agencies, government agencies, development banks and others.</p><p>When offering or receiving meals, gifts, presents, entertainment or hospitality, you should assess:</p><ul><li>What I am offering could be perceived as an attempt to unduly influence actions or decisions of a public or private agent concerning Promon? On the other hand, what I am receiving could be perceived as an attempt to unduly influence my actions or decisions on Promon's behalf?</li><li>What I am offering or receiving is in accordance with our policies and with the policies of the third parties involved?</li><li>What I am offering or receiving could be considered exclusive, luxurious or extraordinary and beyond the context of a commercial relationship?</li><li>Am I offering or receiving presents or other benefits in the course of a commercial decision-making process?</li><li>Does what I am offering or receiving violate local legislation, practices or culture?</li></ul><p>There are circumstances such that refusing meals, gifts, presents, entertainment or hospitality offered by third parties may be construed as a discourtesy, mainly in cases of foreign cultures. In these cases, make the other party understand that it is not possible to follow local customs when they conflict with the Promon’s internal policies.</p><h3>What to do</h3><ul><li>Make your clients, partners and suppliers aware of Promon’s Procedure for <i>Offering and Accepting Meals, Gifts, Presents, Entertainment and Hospitality</i> and recall it whenever you deem necessary, especially on commemorative dates such as year-end parties. </li><li>Consider the third party’s policies when offering meals, gifts, presents, entertainment or hospitality.</li><li>You may accept institutional gifts, with the logo of the third party’s company, such as daily planners, calendars, flash drives and pens.</li><li>Consider the value involved when offering a meal. It should be reasonable and suited to the position occupied by the third party, to the circumstances and the occasion, so as not to give the impression of compromise or the impression of seeking to unduly influence the independence of your judgement when taking commercial decisions.</li><li>When offering or accepting invitations to technical events, such as fairs and workshops promoted by or for several companies, make sure the offer or acceptance does not imply intention to offer or receive undue advantage.</li><li>Trips and lodgings for technical visits may be made in order to exchange experiences between partners, clients or suppliers, as long as they imply no intention to offer or receive undue advantage. In the event that conditions do not comply with Promon’s policies and procedures, get in touch with the Compliance Department.</li><li>Consult your manager or the Compliance Department if you are uncertain about the offer or acceptance of a meal, gift, present, entertainment or hospitality.</li><li>All meals, presents, entertainment and hospitality offered should be duly registered in Promon’s accounting books (it is not necessary to register gifts).</li></ul><h3>What not to do</h3><ul><li>Do not suggest that the third party should offer meals, gifts, presents, entertainment or hospitality. Do not create a situation such that may put the third party in a position where they feel obliged to offer something.</li><li>Whenever commercial decisions are being evaluated do not offer or accept meals, gifts, presents, entertainment or hospitality, directly or indirectly (by way of relatives) which may influence or appear to influence your judgement or that of a third party.</li><li>Do not accept money or its equivalent, such as discounts on travel tickets, lodging and others, as a form of gift.</li><li>Do not offer or receive any meal, giveaway, present, entertainment or hospitality in the event that its eventual disclosure might embarrass you.</li></ul><h3>Get to know more</h3><p>Read the <i>Procedure for Offering and Accepting Meals, Gifts, Presents, Entertainment and Hospitality</i>. In case of doubt, get in touch with the Compliance Department.</p><h3>Situations</h3><p><b>I received a valuable present from a commercial partner in a country that traditionally offers expensive presents. How should I handle the situation?</b> <br> In some cultures, presents play a fundamental role in business relationships. Although it is important to adapt to local customs, you should exercise caution. In no circumstances should you accept a present that may compromise the independence of your judgement when making commercial decisions. Make sure that your commercial partner is aware of the <i>Procedure for Offering and Accepting Meals, Gifts, Presents, Entertainment and Hospitality</i> in order to explain why you cannot accept a valuable present or something that seems to have influence over the commercial relationship between you.</p><p><b>My wife received a present from a Promon client with whom I have a commercial relationship. Do Promon’s policies apply also to my wife, even though she is not an employee of the company?</b> <br>Yes, our Procedure for Offering and Accepting Meals, Gifts, Presents, Entertainment and Hospitality must be followed by our employees’ relatives also, since their acceptance of a meal, gift, present, entertainment or hospitality can be considered as acceptance of the same by our employee through an indirect channel. </p><p><b>I am working on a proposal for a foreign company, a potential client, and they asked me to receive the visit of three senior executives to evaluate one of our operations in Brazil. They would like Promon to pay for trip and all expenses, including entertainment and tourism for members of their families.

However, it makes no sense to pay for their families expenses, whether for the trip, entertainment or anything else. That could be construed as an attempt to influence the client in an unprofessional way and such behavior does not comply with Promon’s policies.</p>"

Immediately after that, you should report the fact to Promon through one of the available vehicles of communication (your immediate superior, the Compliance Department or the Ethical Conduct Channel).
